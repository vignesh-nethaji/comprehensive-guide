# Enterprise Software Development Ethics and Standards
![Enterprise Software Development Ethics and Standards.](images/Enterprise%20Software%20Development%20Ethics%20and%20Standards.png)
- **Developer-Centric Approach** : Run tech teams with a focus on developers rather than business or management.

- **Technical Decisions** : Should be made by technical people to avoid feature creep, bloat, and technical debt.

- **Trade-Offs** : Every decision involves trade-offs that must balance technical and business needs.

- **Technical Debt** : Be vigilant about technical debt and know when to rewrite systems.

- **Trust and Mistakes** : Trust developers and allow them to learn from mistakes.

- **Team Dynamics** : Small, cohesive teams of good developers are more effective than large teams.

- **Methodologies** : Rigid methodologies often fail; tailor methods to the unique needs of the team and environment.

- **Tech Stacks** : Use the right tool for the job and let tech stacks evolve organically. Avoid overcomplicating with unnecessary technologies.

- **Simplicity** : Keep code and tech stacks simple and practical. Avoid overly complex systems like microservices or monolithic architectures without proper trade-offs.

- **FOSS** : Prioritize Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) for both usage and production.

- **Self-Hosting** : Don’t shy away from self-hosting critical systems with robust security measures.

- **Experimentation** : Encourage experimentation as it can lead to significant product successes.

- **Organizational Structure** : Structure the organization like a well-architected software system for flexibility and efficiency.

- **Inter-Team Relationships** : Build meaningful relationships with non-tech teams for feedback and validation.

- **Quality and Consistency** : Maintain high standards for quality and consistency in code and design.

- **Design** : Prioritize good design that considers human interactions and usability.

- **Cost Optimization** : Treat technology costs as engineering challenges and optimize wherever possible.

- **Realistic Expectations** : Accept that not all code will be innovative and that some work will be tedious.

- **Broad Skillset** : Developers should have a broad skillset and gradually build focus.

- **Feature-Freezes** : Don’t hesitate to pause feature development to improve technical quality.

- **Meaningful Work** : Ensure developers find their work meaningful to stay creative and productive.

- **Open Discussions** : Keep all discussions open to everyone.

- **Fun** : Make work fun to reduce stress and maintain a positive environment.

- **Adaptability** : Recognize that nothing is absolute and adapt to changing circumstances.

- **Luck** : Appreciate the role of luck in success and acknowledge the countless small decisions that contribute to it.
